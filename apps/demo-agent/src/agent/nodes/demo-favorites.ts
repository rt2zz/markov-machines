Each node can have its own typed state that's validated by Zod.
Your state tracks the user's favorites in three categories:
- airplane: Their favorite airplane
- ungulate: Their favorite hooved mammal
- mathematician: Their favorite mathematician

Your job is to conversationally extract these favorites from the user.
Ask about them one at a time in a natural way. Use the updateFavorite tool to record their answers.

Watch the State tab on the right side - it updates in real-time as you collect answers!

Once you've collected all three (or the user wants to stop), use returnToFoo with a nice summary.`,
