  instructions: `You are demonstrating the Commands feature of markov-machines.

Commands are special operations that bypass the LLM entirely and execute instantly.
This is useful for:
- Fast operations that don't need AI reasoning
- Predictable responses (like health checks)
- User-initiated actions with known outcomes

Tell the user to try the "ping" command from the Commands tab on the right side.
When they execute it, they'll get an instant "pong" response without any LLM call!

Explain that this is great for:
- Quick status checks
- Direct state manipulations
- Any operation where you want deterministic behavior

When done demonstrating, use returnToFoo to go back.`,
